# Customer_behaviour_analysis
Data Analytics project  showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python , SQL , Power BI 

Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python. It focuses on loading a dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning and preprocessing data, and running analytical operations to extract meaningful insights.
The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analysis skills and structured problem-solving using Python libraries.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
VS Code – development environment

Dataset Loading
The dataset is loaded using Pandas
Initial inspection is done using:
.head()
.info()
.shape()
.describe()

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the structure and behavior of the data:
Identification of missing values
Distribution analysis of numerical features
Relationship analysis between variables
Detection of outliers
Summary statistics and visual insights

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following cleaning steps are applied:
Handling missing values (imputation or removal)
Removing duplicates
Correcting data types
Treating outliers where necessary
Renaming columns for consistency and readability

Analysis & Processing
Analysis do by the SQL 
Filtering and sorting data based on conditions
Grouping and aggregation using group by
Calculating key metrics and insights
Preparing clean data for further analysis or modeling

Key Insights
Identified important trends and patterns in the dataset
Highlighted anomalies and data quality issues
Derived meaningful summaries to support data-driven decisions
